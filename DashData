  "body": "Today, the U.S. Department of Commerce published notice confirming the launch of a Section 232 investigation into whether imports of **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), medical consumables, and medical equipment** pose a threat to national security. The investigation explicitly cites concerns over **foreign nations weaponizing** their control over the supply of these critical items and the potential for foreign exploitation of the supply chain. This is a 'High Priority' alert for the highly globalized medical device and PPE supply chain, as a positive finding could lead to the imposition of sweeping tariffs similar to those on steel and aluminum, dramatically increasing procurement costs and forcing immediate supply chain diversification."
